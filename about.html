      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Mario Tijerino.
        I am a student that is still learning but is capable of building
        "good-looking" and functional websites from scratch.
        I know how to use various coding languages like C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I am also a proud designer and artist. Because of these skills, I am able to 
        build functional websites that can preform a variety of actions and design them
        to be appealing to people who use them.

      <h2>HOW I LEARNED CODE</h2>
      <h3>Prior Experience</h3>
      <p>
        My first experience with anything similar to code was with Microsoft Excel.
        I was twelve years old when I was first introduced to it.
        I started by making simple graphs and charts. Then, I moved on to functions like
        "IF" and "LOOKUP" and made some simple games and applications that could be
        used within the spreadsheet. Back then, it was only a hobby to me.
      </p>
      <h3>Tech Track</h3>
      <p>
        When I was a sophomore in High School. I was taking Pre-Engineering. It
        was a class about the basics of engineering that I took for the CTE
        credit I would need when graduation comes. Although it wasn't my number one career choice, I am very glad
        that I took that class.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just another ordinary day in Pre-Engineering when my Pre-Engineering teacher
        announced that there was going to be a free coding class during the summer that offered $10,000 scholarships. Well, not really "announced,"
        it was more of a, "Hey guys, there is a free coding thing. Put your email on this paper
        if you're interested."
      </p>
      <p>
        I put my email on the paper. I decided it would worth it to give it a shot.
        It would be a chance to move on from spreadsheets to something a bit more professional.
        Also: $10,000 scholarship. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am taking Tech Track. So far, I have learned C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I am still learning so expect that list of skills to grow.

      <h2>HOW I LEARNED DESIGN</h2>
      <p>
        During junior high and my first year in high school, I wanted to focus 
        on developing my art skills in hopes of becoming a professional artist in
        the future, so I took a few art classes.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Ad Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        I took Advertising Design during my sophomore year in high school. I learned
        how to make digital art as well as layout design. I know how to use applications like
        photoshop to make commercial art. I also earned a certificate in Ad Design.
